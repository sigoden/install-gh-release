# Install-gh-release

A website to automatically generate bash script to install binary published on github releases.

## Usage

The main scenario for the website is in the readme of the command line application.

Providing install script is much more convenient than just a link to github releases.

You can add following content to your readme.

```md
[Manual Install](https://sigoden.github.io/install-gh-release/index.html?repo=sigoden/argc)
```

The user click that, will see the install script.
